"""Greedy reference policy used as starter-code scoring floor.

This is a performance-optimized rewrite of the original straightforward
implementation. The decision rules and tie-breaking are bit-for-bit
identical — verified by replaying full simulations against the original
(`scripts/verify_baseline_equivalence.py`) — so scores and replays are
reproducible across versions; only the cost changed (~5x faster: static-grid
precomputation plus a leaner BFS inner loop).
